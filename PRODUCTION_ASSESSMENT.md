## **ADVANCED FEATURES THAT IMPRESS INTERVIEWERS**

### 1. **Self-Healing Architecture**
```python
# Automatic storage cleanup
cleanup_manager.start_background_cleanup()

# Keep-alive system prevents downtime
keep_alive_manager.start_keep_alive()
```

### 2. **Enterprise Security Model**
```python
# Multi-layered protection
@require_admin
@limiter.limit("10 per minute") 
@csrf.exempt  # Where appropriate
def secure_endpoint():
    pass
```

### 3. **Production Monitoring**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" https://app.render.com/storage-stats
# Returns: storage usage, file counts, cleanup statistics
```

### 4. **Zero-Downtime Deployment**
- Environment-based configuration
- Graceful error handling
- Health check endpoints
- Background service management

## **DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS**

### Local Development
```bash
# Setup
git clone <repo>
cd AlaeAutomates2.0
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run
export SECRET_KEY=$(python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))")
