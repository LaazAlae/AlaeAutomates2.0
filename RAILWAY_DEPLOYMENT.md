# Deploy to Railway - 100% Free Solution

## Why Railway Instead of Vercel

**The Problem with Vercel**: Python libraries like PyMuPDF require native C compilation, which Vercel's serverless functions don't support well. Your app failed to deploy because of these dependencies.

**Railway Solution**: Full Linux containers that support all Python libraries, 1GB memory, and better suited for Flask applications.

## Step-by-Step Railway Deployment

### 1. Sign Up for Railway
- Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- Click "Start a New Project"
- Sign up with GitHub (free account)

### 2. Deploy Your Project
- Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
- Select your `AlaeAutomates2.0` repository
- Railway will automatically detect it's a Python app
- Click "Deploy"

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard, go to Variables tab and add:
```
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
ADMIN_TOKEN=your-admin-token-here
PORT=5000
```

Generate secure keys:
```bash
python -c "import secrets; print('SECRET_KEY=' + secrets.token_hex(32))"
python -c "import secrets; print('ADMIN_TOKEN=' + secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

### 4. Wait for Deployment
- Railway will build and deploy automatically (3-5 minutes)
- You'll get a live URL like: `https://your-app-production.up.railway.app`

## Railway vs Other Platforms

| Feature | Railway | Vercel | Render |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Free Plan** | ✅ $5 credit/month | ✅ Forever* | ❌ No free tier |
| **Python Support** | ✅ Full Linux | ❌ Serverless only | ✅ Full Linux |
| **Memory** | ✅ 1GB | ✅ 1GB | ❌ 512MB |
| **File Processing** | ✅ 50MB+ | ❌ Function limits | ✅ 25MB |
| **Build Time** | ✅ Fast | ❌ Failed | ✅ Slow |
| **C Dependencies** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

*Vercel free tier doesn't work with your Python dependencies

## Cost Breakdown

**Railway Free Usage:**
- $5 credit per month (automatically applied)
- Your app will use ~$3-4/month in normal usage
- Essentially **FREE for hobby projects**

**What you get:**
- ✅ 1GB memory (2x more than old Render)
- ✅ Full Linux environment (supports PyMuPDF)
- ✅ Fast builds and deployments
- ✅ Auto-scaling
- ✅ Custom domains

## After Deployment

1. **Test your app** at the Railway URL
2. **Process a PDF** to make sure everything works
3. **Check logs** in Railway dashboard if needed
4. **Set up custom domain** if desired (optional)

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Build fails
- Check the build logs in Railway dashboard
- Usually it's an environment variable issue

**Problem**: App starts but crashes
- Check the deploy logs
- Make sure all environment variables are set

**Problem**: Can't process PDFs
- This shouldn't happen on Railway since it supports PyMuPDF

## Why This Will Work

1. **Full Linux containers** - Supports all your Python libraries
2. **1GB memory** - More than enough for PDF processing  
3. **No function timeouts** - Can process large files
4. **Proper Python support** - Built specifically for apps like yours

Railway is honestly the best choice for your Flask app. It's what Render used to be before they removed their free tier.
